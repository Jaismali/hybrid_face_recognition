# Hybrid_face_recognition
🖥️ Face Recognition using Deep Learning &amp; Haar Cascades This repository contains a face recognition system that combines Deep Learning with Haar Cascades for accurate and efficient face detection and recognition.

 🚀 How Haar Cascades & Deep Learning Work Together
🔹 Haar Cascades for Face Detection – Quickly detects faces in images or video streams.  
🔹 Deep Learning for Face Recognition – Extracts unique face encodings and matches them with known faces.  
🔹 Hybrid Approach – Ensures fast and accurate face recognition by using Haar Cascades for detection and Deep Learning for recognition.  

🚀 Future Improvements  
- Implement Federated Learning for privacy-focused recognition.  
- Use a CNN-based face detection model instead of Haar Cascades.  
- Optimize for low-light conditions.
